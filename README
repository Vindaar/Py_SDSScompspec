This is the first version of the SDSScompspec program in Python, which 
is capable of running on multiple cores. There is a single core and a
multicore version of the program.
Therefore the functions and the main program have been seperated.
Single Core program:
PyS_SDSScompspec
Multi Core program:
PyS_SDSScompspec_multicore

They are still run by:
./PyS_SDSScompspec <list file>

So far, in the multicore file the number of processes is set to 8, since 
my computer has 4 physical cores with 8 threads.
In the next version it will be possible to set the number of used cores 
from the command line.

The extrem memory usage has been mostly resolved, by freeing flux, flux_error,
wave, and powerlaw arrays after each spectrum.
