This version is the first almost finished version. 

The memory related problems are gone, fixed by removing unecessary 
arrays after each loop. 
Dust corrections have been implemented, which can be called if the
program is run with the --dust flag.

Additionally statistics are calculated and all sorts of information
is written to the header of the FITS file and the table 
containing information about the QSOs is written as well.
