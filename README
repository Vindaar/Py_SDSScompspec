This is the first version of SDSS-Compspec in Python.
It works similar to the C program, run with:
./PyS_SDSS-compspec <list file>


It creates the an output FITS file, containing the opacities, its errors and the number of contributing QSOs for each pixel.

Some things are still hardcoded (some constants).

Main problems:
It is a lot slower than its C counterpart
and
it uses a ton of memory, because big arrays are not given back to the system, after they are useful.
